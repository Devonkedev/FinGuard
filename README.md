### Project Proposal
Our startup aims to capitalize on the growing demand for comprehensive cybersecurity solutions, particularly in the financial services sector, which is experiencing rapid growth due to rising concerns over fraud and data breaches.

Our application offers a robust, unified platform designed to prevent scams and fraud through advanced detection methods, including the analysis of hyperlinks, messages, and emails. It provides previews and alerts for suspicious content, ensuring users avoid malicious sites. The app also prevents personal data breaches by monitoring and censoring sensitive information in messages and online activities. Additionally, it offers secure storage for financial documents and credentials, integrating with services like DigiLocker for enhanced protection. Our solution combines multiple security features into one platform, providing comprehensive protection against modern cyber threats.
